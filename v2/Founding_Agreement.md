Vesting and cliffs
==================

All shares granted by the company have a monthly vesting schedule of VESTING_PERIOD. Each shareholder has an individual starting date with the company, and a number of shares appropriate according to his level.


Internal investment of funds
============================

In order to make sure the business has sufficient funds to operate until external investment is raised, we outline a process for "internal investment" by any stakeholder in the business. 

1. Via a board decision, the business may raise funds from its stakeholders in the form of an owner loan. In this case, pending board approval, any stakeholder may lend funds the business, at zero interest rate. At any point in time, the lender may choose to withdraw such funds, pending prior notification of 7 days to the board of directors and the availability of funds in the business. In case no funds are available for withdrawal, the business will remain indebted to the lender, and will have first right to any future internal or external investment that the business raises in the future.
2. The above clause does not preclude other investment that include an interest rate, convertible notes, options, or another form of compensation for the internal investor in exchange for the risk that he is taking. As usual, the board may offer specific terms to any internal or external investor that are different than those outlined in the above clause.
